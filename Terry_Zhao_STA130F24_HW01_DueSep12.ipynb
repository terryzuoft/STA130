    "A reasonable characterization of STA130 Homework is that it simply defines a weekly reading comprehension assignment. \n",
    "Indeed, STA130 Homework essentially boils down to completing various understanding confirmation exercises oriented around coding and writing tasks.\n",
    "However, rather than reading a textbook, STA130 Homework is based on ChatBots so students can interactively follow up to clarify questions or confusion that they may still have regarding learning objective assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Communication is a fundamental skill underlying statistics and data science, so STA130 Homework based on ChatBots helps practice effective two-way communication as part of a \"realistic\" dialogue activity supporting underlying conceptual understanding building. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will likely become increasingly tempting to rely on ChatBots to \"do the work for you\". But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

    "The questions (as copy-pasted prompts) are designed to initialize appropriate ChatBot conversations which can be explored in the manner of an interactive and dynamic textbook; but, it is nonetheless **strongly recommendated** that your rephrase the questions in a way that you find natural to ensure a clear understanding of the question. Given sensible prompts the represent a question well, the two primary challenges observed to arise from ChatBots are \n",

    "1. conversations going beyond the intended scope of the material addressed by the question; and, \n",
    "2. unrecoverable confusion as a result of sequential layers logial inquiry that cannot be resolved. \n",

    "In the case of the former (1), adding constraints specifying the limits of considerations of interest tends to be helpful; whereas, the latter (2) is often the result of initial prompting that leads to poor developments in navigating the material, which are likely just best resolve by a \"hard reset\" with a new initial approach to prompting.
